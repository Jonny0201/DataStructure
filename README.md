# Data Structure

Project Name : Data Structure

## Introduction

Data structure is the base of the computer programming.

It helps programmers store and handle data.

Data Structure is imitating by C++ Standard Template Library, however, what you should focus on is that there are an abundance of discrepancies with C++ STL. All the discrepancies that can confuse you I will introduce one by one.

Data Structrue can be used in any programs.

## Module

This Data Structure written by Jonny in C++ will include :

```
1. List
2. Stack
3. Queue
4. Dictionary
5. Tree
6. Graph
7. Hash
8. Heap
```

## Base



## Completed

>- Vector : Vector is a sequence container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays.
>- ForwardList : ForwardList is a container that supports fast insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container.
>- List : List is a container that supports constant time insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container.
>- Deque : Deque (double-ended queue) is an indexed sequence container that allows fast insertion and deletion at both its beginning and its end.
>- Stack : Default Stack is a container adapter that gives the programmer the functionality of a stack - specifically, a FILO (first-in, last-out) data structure.
>- BilateralStack : A stack who is in high space-utilization rate. There are two stacks in every bilateral stack.
>- Queue : Default Queue is a container adapter that gives the programmer the functionality of a queue - specifically, a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure.

## Coming Soon...

>- StaticList
>- PriorityQueue
>- String
>- HeapString
>- BlockingLinkedString

## Environment

 ```
 macOS 10.13.6
 CLion 2018.2
 Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2)
 ```

The programme is based on C++ 11. So when you compile, you should add the command :

`-std=c++11`
