# Data Structure

Project Name : Data Structure

Aim : Hopes it can help improve my programming skill!

## Introduction

Data structure is the base of the computer programming.

It helps programmers store and handle data.

----------------------------

### Module

This Data Structure written by Jonny in C++ will include :

```
1. List
2. Stack
3. Queue
4. Dictionary
5. Tree
6. Graph
7. Hash
8. Heap
```
 
----------------------------

### How I write?

I write it by imitating by C++ Standard Template Library and set protection to some functions I think it shouldn't be used casually and now is being protected by `#define`.

----------------------------

### Where you can use?

It can be used in all situations where you are going to write or design a algorithm.

----------------------------

### Which I have added?

The list of data structures next is had been done and you can look throught the codes in my GitHub :

>- Vector : It is designed by array whose behaviour like an array.

----------------------------

### Which is going to be added?

The next list is going to be added to my GitHub, it is coming soon :

>- ForwardLinkedList
>- StaticList
>- CircleLinkedList
>- Stack
>- BilateralStack
>- LinkedStack
>- Queue
>- LinkedQueue
>- CircularQueue
>- PriorityQueue
>- Deque
>- String
>- HeapString
>- BlockingLinkedString

----------------------------

### What evironment I should use?

My test evironment :
>macOS 10.13.4
 CLion 2018.1
 Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1)

The programme is based on C++ 11. So when you compile, you should add the command :
`-std=c++11`
